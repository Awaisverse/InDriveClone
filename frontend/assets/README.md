# Assets Folder

This folder should contain the following image files for the app:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px recommended)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (foreground image)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon

**Note**: The app will work in Expo Go even without these images - Expo will use default placeholders. However, for a production build, you'll need to add these images.

You can generate these images using:
- Online tools like https://www.appicon.co/
- Design tools like Figma, Photoshop, etc.
- Expo's asset generator
